# Rebanking Challenge with React native and Typescript

## Description 
In this application you can see a List of products to which you can execute a click to see the complete detail of it.

## Setup
1- Clone repository `git clone https://github.com/MarceeloDominguez/challenge-reba.git`</br>
2- Install dependencies with `npm install` </br>
3- Run App with  `npx react-native run-android`

## More Comments:
I need to add: </br>
1- Create an option to check/uncheck list items like
favourites. These elements should appear at the beginning of the list and
persist between sessions of use of the application. </br>
2- Create at least one unit test in Jest.
